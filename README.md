This project is a simple face-detection-based attendance system built using OpenCV and Python.
It uses a Haar Cascade classifier to detect faces in real-time through a webcam and logs the timestamp whenever a face is detected.

Currently, the system only detects faces and stores the detection time in a log file.
In the next stage, the project will be upgraded to face recognition so it can identify individuals (by name) and mark their attendance.
